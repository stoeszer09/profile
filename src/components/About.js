        Hello, I'm Phillip Splettstoeszer, a passionate fullstack developer with a love for crafting digital experiences. My journey in the world of coding began 15 years ago during high school physics class when I used python to do some modelling, and it's been an incredible ride ever since. Over the years, I've honed my skills through dedicated learning, including a comprehensive boot camp that equipped me with a robust toolset that includes: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Express, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and Python. I thrive on the creative process of building elegant and efficient web solutions. Whether it's front-end magic with React or optimizing back-end performance, I'm always eager to tackle new challenges and bring visions to life in the digital realm. Let's work together to turn your web development dreams into reality!
